    "## First, a note about Jupyter Magics\n",
    "Jupyter supports lots of languages, with Python and Markdown being the defaults. However, we can easily mix in code other languages using so-called *magic* extensions. By prepending foreign code with a few *magic* characters (sort of like an incantation) the code that follows is then run, with any outputs translated into Jupyter's native namespace (data structures). So, we can have Python code call R code which calls Bash code ..., all with just a little magic. \n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter magics generally start with the `%` character. A bunch of them are [built into Jupyter](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/interactive/magics.html) without any installation required. A few useful ones:\n",
    "- `%cd`, which changes the directory in which the code that follows is run\n",
    "- `%load_ext`, which we saw used above to load the %sql and %%sql magics\n",
    "- `%matplotlb`, which sets up the matplotlib library for interactive use\n",
    "- `%%bash`, which executes Bash commands just like in a Terminal tab\n",
    "- `%%html`, which renders HTML code for direct display in the notebook\n",
    "- `%%js`, which executes Javascript code\n",
    "\n",
    "You may have noticed that some magics start with `%` while others start with `%%`. \n",
    "- The ones with `%` are run \"inline\" so they can be mixed directly into other code. This way one could for example, have Python code that directly calls SQL code to pull data from a database (without having to set up SqlAlchemy). If the magic code returns an output value, then that value can be captured with a variable. The ony real draw-back is that inline magics have to be on a single line and can's have any line breaks.\n",
    "- The ones with `%%` are _cell magics_ that apply to a whole cell. Cell magics are always by themselves on the first line of a cell. The code on the lines below are then processed via the magic. If the cell returns a value then it is displayed immediately by Jupyter. However, if we want to capture that value in a variable then we have to use a special [kludge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kludge) included in Jupyter for just this purpose. In Jupyter, the special variable `_` (yes, that's an underscore) always contains the output value of the most recently run cell. \n",

    "The database we will be using is the `Lahman 2016` data repository that you may have already seen in other classes. We are using it as a sort of common data set that conencts the courses. The database includes [historical baseball data from 1871-2016](https://github.com/jknecht/baseball-archive-sqlite). \n",
    "\n",
    "The database tech used is SQLite, a very lightweight package that keeps all data in a single file (sort of like a document) that can be copied and even versioned in GitHub. This has lots of advantages for business analysts. Any time the analysts need data, they can _extract_ it from the DBMS server into a local SQLite database and then _transform_ it in SQLite (or Python or R) prior to analysis. They lose real-time data timeliness, but gain lots of control over way the data is organized.    \n",

    "This can be pretty confusing for SQL newbies. There are no SQL commands for listing all the tables in a database. Instead, we query one or more _metadata_ tables.

    "- `type` -- generally either 'table' or 'index'\n",
    "- `name` -- the object name (which is equal to tbl_name if the object is a table)\n",
